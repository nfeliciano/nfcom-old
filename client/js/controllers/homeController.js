With regards to development, I find the most joy in picking new things up and solving problems with others. I hope to work in educational technology, mobile or web application development, games, or an intersection of the three. I live in beautiful Victoria, BC, graduating with an MSc in Computer Science from UVic, and while I'm no longer a student, I will always be a learner.";
